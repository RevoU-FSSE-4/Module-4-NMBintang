### Tasks:

1. **Module 4 Checkpoint:**
   - Develop a multistep form that functions within a single page but renders multiple components containing personal information, address information, and account information.

2. **Module 4 Assignment:**
   - Create three pages: Register, Login, and Category.
   - Implement API logic for each page:
     - Register: Use POST method.
     - Login: Use POST method.
     - Category:
       - Use DELETE method on the delete button and logout.
       - Use PUT to update categories.
       - Utilize GET method to retrieve category by ID and all categories.

### Implementation:
Since there's only one `app.tsx` file available in folder new-app:
- Import `MultiStepForm` to test the multistep program for the Module 4 Checkpoint.
- Import `MainPage` for the Module 4 Assignment.
